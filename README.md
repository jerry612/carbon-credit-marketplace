# Tokenized-Carbon Credit Marketplace (on Polygon/Matic)

***

## 【Introduction of the Tokenized-Carbon Credit Marketplace (on Polygon/Matic)】
- This is a smart contract and dApp that is the Tokenized-Carbon Credit Marketplace which allow to be able to claim, audit, buy/sell carbon credits in a single platform. (for incentivize and accelerating the CO2 emission reduction)
  - By that whole process is executed on this platform, it is able to keep `transparency` and `traceability` .
  - The `Carbon Credit Tokens (CCTs)` are used for representing amount of carbon credits. (The Carbon Credit Tokens is created as ERC20 token)
  - `Green NFT` is used for a `proof of audit` of CO2 reductions for a project
  - This smart contract is deployed on `Polygon` (previously `Matic Network` ) in order to save cost of transaction and realize faster transactions. 

&nbsp;

## 【Workflow】
- ① A project owner (e.g. organizations, corporations, etc...) register themself on this dApp.
- ② A auditor (e.g. the institutions to issue carbon credit) is registered on this dApp.
  - Only admin (deployer of smart contracts) can register a auditor.

- ③ A project owner claim CO2 reductions to a auditor.
- ④ Auditor audit (=approve) a claim from a project owner.
  - Once a claim is audited, the `Green NFT` and the Carbon Credit Tokens (CCTs) are given (=charged) into a project owner's wallet.
  - A `Green NFT` represents a `proof of audit` of CO2 reductions for a project that is claimed.
  - Given-Carbon Credit Tokens (CCTs) are same amount with audited-amount of CO2 reductions.

- ⑤ A project owner put a Green NFT (=proof of audit) and the Carbon Credit Tokens (CCTs) on sale.
- ⑥ A buyer can buy the Carbon Credit Tokens (CCTs) based on GreenNFT in the carbon credit marketplace.
  - Once buying process is successful, CCTs that are bought by a buyer will be transferred into a buyer's wallet.
    (※ At that time, a Green NFT is not transferred. A Green NFT is kept in the project owner's wallet as a proof of audit)
  - That buyer can sell CCTs bought in the marketplace as secondary sales.
  - Price rate of the Carbon Credit Tokens (CCTs) is `1 CCT = 1 MATIC`

## 【Setup】

### Setup private network by using Ganache-CLI
1. Download Ganache-CLI from link below  
https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache  


2. Execute Ganache   
```
$ ganache-cli -d
```
※ `-d` option is the option in order to be able to use same address on Ganache-CLI every time.

&nbsp;


### Setup wallet by using Metamask
1. Add MetaMask to browser (Chrome or FireFox or Opera or Brave)    
https://metamask.io/  


2. Adjust appropriate newwork below (In case of deploying smart contract on local)
```
http://127.0.0.1:8545
```

2. Adjust appropriate newwork below (In case of deploying smart contract on Polygon's Mumbai testnet)
```
https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com/
```
(More configuration detail is here: https://docs.matic.network/docs/develop/metamask/config-matic/ )

### Setup backend

- In case of deploying smart contracts on local
```
$ npm run migrate:local
```

&nbsp;

- In case of deploying smart contract on `Matic's Mumbai testnet`
```
$ npm run migrate:polygon_testnet
```

&nbsp;

<br>


### Setup frontend
